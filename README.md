## General Information
- Lending club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
- When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:
  * Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:
    1. Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)
    2. Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.
    3. Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan 
 * Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.).
  Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset)
- The dataset is used from the time period of 2007 to 2011

## Conclusions
- There were around 14% of loan defaulters
- People have taken short term loans more than long term loans
- The loans which were taken were majorily the people who already had loans and took to repay other loans
- Only 25% loan applicants are source verified
- If the interest rate is high, there will be high chance for user to become loan defaulter
